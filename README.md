# 🤖 GCP Dialogflow CX Conversational Agent Project

This project showcases a complete setup and deployment of a **Dialogflow CX-based Conversational Agent** using **Google Cloud Platform**. The goal was to explore how to create, manage, test, and version conversational agents in a professional environment.

---

## 🚀 Features Implemented

1. **Created a Dialogflow CX Agent**
   - Configured intents, flows, entities, and route groups.

2. **Imported Agent from .blob File**
   - Used `.blob` virtual agent import to replicate/reuse a previously built agent.

3. **Draft Environment Testing**
   - Ran tests in the default draft environment to validate basic flows.

4. **Created Custom Environments**
   - Set up multiple environments for testing, QA, and staging.

5. **Environment Testing**
   - Verified agent performance and responses in new environments.

6. **Created Multiple Agent Versions**
   - Used versioning to maintain stability and track changes between iterations.

7. **Deployed to Additional Environments**
   - Pushed different agent versions to specific environments.

8. **Managed Environment Versions**
   - Practiced rollback, switching versions, and version control.
